### Description
Serenity is an all-purpose bot that allows you to replace all bots with paywalls for free! Some features include:
- Full moderation suite (including automod)
- Leveling
- Antiraid

### Installation Guide
Here is the guide for installing Serenity for its maximum potential:

**` Step 1 `** ・ Add the bot with [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1234679407939948635&permissions=144955010295&scope=bot+applications.commands).
- We ask that you keep all permissions enabled to ensure all features will work properly. We do not ask for the Administrator permission, as we do not need it.

**` Step 2 `** ・ Setup the bot with `>dashboard [module]`.
- You can enable, disable, and configurate modules with this command. You can view all modules with `>modules`.

**` Step 3 `** ・ Any questions? DM @alohazzzzz on Discord.
- We plan to open a support server, however it will not be available until release.
